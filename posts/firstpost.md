## Piecing Together a Workout...Where Do I Start?


State Gym at Iowa State University provides ample equipment to tackle any desired muscle group. It has certain grouping of machines strewn across the building in hopes of a more effective layout. For example, many cardio machines are along the top floor overlooking the squat racks. And furthering that, the squat racks are all next to each other. State is one of the two gyms on campus for Iowa State students. Many resources have to be provided in the building to give students an oppurtunity for a great exercise, no matter what they plan on working out. People come to the gym for many reasons, and not everyone likes to go about or should go about exercise in the same manner. But one of the more unanimous problems is how to go about a workoout effectively. This can lead to the "where do I start?" dilemma. Luckily, State Gym has many resources that point at possibilities to answer this. This article hopes to assist you while traversing State Gym and its many machines. This article gives insight on how you can utilize machines and areas within the gym to conquer workouts focused on weight training, core strength, cardio, and even...mindfulness! Some have been tried, some are educated quesses, and this doesn't stop you from experimenting on your own. But maybe it can help with the often daunting question of "where do I start?".

## Chest Day

Hitting your pectoral muscles at the gym allow for you to acquire a stronger push, a bigger and broader chest, and can be found bouncing around on famous actor and gymgoer: Terry Crews. Chest day is looked upon by many gymgoers as an objectively great day to be alive. The "pump" or bloodflow that a chest workout allows is aesthetically pleasing and can make someone feel closer to Arnold Schwarzenegger. It requires strong pushing motions that can be seen in exercises such as the flat barbell bench press, incline dumbbell bench press, cable chest flys, and bodyweight exercises such as dips and pushups. Pushups are a great ally in growing your chest when no equipment is around. But to continually grow your chest in an effective manner, you most likely want to combine multiple exercises. This is to activate all portions of the chest for comprehensive functioning and appearance.  This can be done with the help of both machines and free weights. 

After a quick glimpse into the dynamics of a chest day, below are exercises along with what equipment they use, what muscles are recruited, and tips so you can piece together a great chest day.
