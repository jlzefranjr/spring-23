## Piecing Together a Workout...Where Do I Start?


To achieve a holistic (meaning all inclusive approach) to wellbeing, you need to address the trinity of good health: your mind, body, and spirit. There is countless studies over exercise nutrition and other avenues for seeing how what we eat affects our physcial abilities. There is also food that speaks to our spirit (soul), such as a cup of tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich when we are sick. This speaks to more comforting side of food. But, how does what we eat affect what's happening in the control room? Our brains require certain vitmains and nutrients to avoid defeciencies. A poor diet and defeciences can lead to common mental ailments such as depression, anxiety, OCD, and over stressing. This is beacsue what we feed our brain isn't always good for it. As one last note in this paragraph, the term "Brain Food" was popularized by Mrs. Serafin, a grade school computer teacher of mine who was always quick to kindness. She always had candy which was coined "brain food" for students who did well or participated, or even if it was for no reason at all. For the sake of keeping her legacy alive and exploring some God given resources to strengthen the mind, let us dive into this article.

## Chest Day

Hitting your pectoral muscles (chest) at the gym allow for you to acquire a stronger push, a bigger and broader chest, and may allow you to pec bounce just like Terry Crews. Chest day is looked upon by many gymgoers as an objectively great day to be alive. The "pump" or bloodflow that a chest workout allows is aesthetically pleasing and can make someone feel closer to Arnold Schwarzenegger. It requires strong pushing motions that can be seen in exercises such as the flat barbell bench press, incline dumbbell bench press, cable chest flys, and bodyweight exercises such as dips and pushups. Pushups are a great ally in growing your chest when no equipment is around. But to enhance your chest workouts over time, you likely want to combine exercises. This will activate all portions of the chest for more well-rounded functioning and appearance.  

A worthy chest day can be done with both machines and/or free weights. Below are exercises with what equipment they use, what muscles are recruited, and tips so you can piece together your own chest day.

- Incline Dumbbell Bench
-   Equipment Used: Dumbells, Bench
-   Muscles Recruited: Upper Chest, Shoulders, Arms, Core
-   Tips: Smooth/controlled motion, retract scapula, don't have to "clink" at the top

- Dumbbell Chest Flys
-   Equipment Used: Dumbells, Bench
-   Muscles Recruited: Middle Chest, Shoulders, Biceps, Arms, Core
-   Tips: Smooth/controlled motion, end with weights directly over your shoulders, allow the weight to assit your arms downward, recruit stability from your core

- Incline Barbell Bench Press
-   Equipment Used: Barbell, Bench, Weight Clips, (spotter when needed)
-   Muscles Recruited: Upper Chest, Upper Back, Shoulders, Arms, Core
-   Tips: Smooth/controlled motion, retract scapula, find hand placement along bar that aligns with your shoulders, try to keep elbows in throughout the motion

- Bodyweight/Weighted Dips
-   Equipment Used: Dip Machine 
-     if additional weight is desired: Dumbbells, Chain Belt when using Plates
-   Muscles Recruited: Entire Chest, Upper Back, Shoulders, Arms, Core
-   Tips: Try to keep elbows in to prevent "Tennis elbow", engage your core to lighten the load (as opposed to a dead weight), try to feel a nice stretch out of your chest muscles during the downward motion, and a combined push during the upward motion
