No, this isn't promoting a limitless pill, but that could be a good comparison for what follows. Here is some insight on cognitive supporting ingredients. These ingredients do so by a proposition of essential vitamins and nutrients needed by the brain. This information isn't meant to diagnose, treat, or cure any illness or disease. The objective is that this short article allows more awareness around foods that nurture the "commnd center" in our heads. The mission is that more awareness can lead to better choices for the health of your brain, so that your brain can continue to work the best it can for as long as it can. Trusting your gut works wonnders, but so does caring for your mind and taking steps now to further brain health in the long run. 


To achieve a holistic (meaning all inclusive approach) to wellbeing, you need to address the trinity of good health: your mind, body, and spirit. There is countless studies over exercise nutrition and other avenues for seeing how what we eat affects our physcial abilities. There is also food that speaks to our spirit (soul), such as a cup of tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich when we are sick. This speaks to more comforting side of food. But, how does what we eat affect what's happening in the control room? Our brains require certain vitmains and nutrients to avoid defeciencies. A poor diet and defeciences can lead to common mental ailments such as depression, anxiety, OCD, and over stressing. This is beacsue what we feed our brain isn't always good for it. As one last note in this paragraph, the term "Brain Food" was popularized by Mrs. Serafin, a grade school computer teacher of mine who was always quick to kindness. She always had candy which was coined "brain food" for students who did well or participated, or even if it was for no reason at all. For the sake of keeping her legacy alive and exploring some God given resources to strengthen the mind, let us dive into this article.
