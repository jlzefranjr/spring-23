## Chest Day

Hitting your pectoral muscles (chest) at the gym allow for you to acquire a stronger push, a bigger and broader chest, and may allow you to pec bounce just like Terry Crews. Chest day is looked upon by many gymgoers as an objectively great day to be alive. The "pump" or bloodflow that a chest workout allows is aesthetically pleasing and can make someone feel closer to Arnold Schwarzenegger. It requires strong pushing motions that can be seen in exercises such as the flat barbell bench press, incline dumbbell bench press, cable chest flys, and bodyweight exercises such as dips and pushups. Pushups are a great ally in growing your chest when no equipment is around. But to enhance your chest workouts over time, you likely want to combine exercises. This will activate all portions of the chest for more well-rounded functioning and appearance.  

A worthy chest day can be done with both machines and/or free weights. Below are exercises with what equipment they use, what muscles are recruited, and tips so you can piece together your own chest day.
