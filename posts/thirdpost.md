## Prioritizing Regular Exercise In College

Higher education can bring along with it growth in many domains. And while growth is inevitable, someone's environment can make it easier for it to take hold. Both internal and external factors can lead to someone's capacity for growth. For example, having an open mind is a great for priming your internal environment. Another example is being surrounded by others who desire similar goals, which primes your external environment. Fitting in regular exercise can seem challenging with the many time commitments of a college student. There are many responsibilities along with the recommendation for regular exercise. But one thing many can benefit from is a trip to the gym. 


The gym provides a place where people can improve their physical health and mental health even after one visit. Over time, this habit can prove great improvements in overall wellbeing. Therefore, making it a routine of working out at the gym is a catalyst for growth. When someone is working nonstop on school work they're less able to find time for exercise. Although benders at the library can boost GPA (as inferred by Pub Med's study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29170702/), too much time not exercising can lead to less cardiovascular endurance and heightened sedentary behavior. So these following paragraphs will hint at how college students can incorporate more physical exercise in their life by attending the gym. This can lead to improved physical and mental health, and instill habits for wellbeing that continue to transpire following graduation.
